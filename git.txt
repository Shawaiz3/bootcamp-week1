Absolutely! Let's go step-by-step in **very simple beginner-friendly language** to explain all the key Git & GitHub **terminologies** and then explain the **overall process** you followed.

---

## 🔑 Key Git & GitHub Terminologies

### 1. **Repository (Repo)**

A **repo** is just a folder for your project **stored on GitHub**.
It contains your **code, files, history, and changes**.

📦 *Think of it like a Google Drive folder for your code.*

---

### 2. **Git**

Git is a **tool** that tracks every change you make in your code, like a time machine.
It allows you to:

* Save your work (with commits)
* Go back to old versions
* Work with others without messing up each other's code

---

### 3. **Commit**

A **commit** is a **snapshot of your code at a moment in time**.

📝 *Think of it like "Save Game" in a video game.*

```bash
git commit -m "Added login page"
```

This means: *“I’ve saved this version of my project and described what I changed.”*

---

### 4. **Branch**

A **branch** is like a **copy of your code** where you can make changes **safely** without affecting the main version.

🪴 *Imagine you duplicate your project, try new features there, and merge it back only if everything works.*

* `main` = official code
* `feature/readme` = temporary copy for adding a README

```bash
git checkout -b feature/readme
```

---

### 5. **Push**

**Push** means "send" your changes **from your computer to GitHub**.

```bash
git push origin main
```

🌍 Now your code lives on GitHub so others (and you) can access it online.

---

### 6. **Pull Request (PR)**

A **Pull Request** is a **request to add your changes into another branch**, usually into `main`.

🔄 *It's like asking: “Hey, I made some changes, can we add them to the main project?”*

Others can:

* Review your changes
* Approve them
* Merge them (combine them with the main branch)

---

### 7. **Merge**

**Merge** means combining two branches into one — usually adding your changes to `main`.

🧩 *Like gluing your small branch back into the main tree once you’re done testing.*

## ✅ The Whole GitHub Process (Simplified)

Let’s break down what you just did:

| Step | What You Did                     | Real World Meaning                              |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Created a repo                   | Made an empty folder for your project on GitHub |
| 2    | `git init`                       | Told Git to start tracking your code            |
| 3    | `git add .`                      | Selected which files to save                    |
| 4    | `git commit`                     | Saved a version of your project                 |
| 5    | `git push`                       | Uploaded that version to GitHub                 |
| 6    | `git branch`                     | Created a safe copy to try new things           |
| 7    | `git checkout -b feature/readme` | Switched to that copy                           |
| 8    | Edited README.md                 | Made changes in the copy                        |
| 9    | `git commit` + `push`            | Saved and uploaded changes                      |
| 10   | Opened PR                        | Asked GitHub to add those changes to main       |
| 11   | Merged PR                        | Combined your copy into the real project        |

## 🎉 Now You Know!

You now understand:

* What Git is
* What GitHub is
* What branches, commits, PRs, and merging mean
* The entire workflow from coding → committing → pushing → PR → merging

### 🧠 Summary (In Words)

1. You started with the `main` branch.
2. You created a new branch `feature/readme`.
3. You made and committed changes in the new branch.
4. You pushed them to GitHub.
5. You opened a PR (Pull Request) to merge it into `main`.
6. You merged it — and now the main branch has your changes.

Great observation! In **VS Code**, the **"M"** stands for:

> ✅ **Modified**

---

### 💡 Explanation:

When you're working inside a **Git-tracked project**, VS Code shows file status in the **Source Control panel**.

| Symbol | Meaning                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `M`    | **Modified** — file was changed but **not yet staged/committed** |
| `U`    | Untracked — new file not added to Git yet                        |
| `A`    | Added — file staged to be committed                              |
| `D`    | Deleted — file deleted but not yet committed                     |
| `R`    | Renamed                                                          |
| `C`    | Copied                                                           |

---

### 🛠 What You Can Do:

If you see `M` after editing:

1. Run:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   You'll see the modified files listed.

2. To **stage** the change:

   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```

3. To **commit** the change:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
   ```

After that, the `M` will disappear because your changes are saved in Git.
